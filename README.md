# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains Python solutions to various problems from Project Euler.

## What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just
mathematical insights to solve. The problems are intended to be solved using computer programs, although the
mathematical aspect is also important.

## Structure of the Repository

Each Python script in this repository corresponds to a specific problem from Project Euler. The scripts are named
according to the problem number and briefly describe the problem they solve. Below is a brief description of each
script:

1. **euler1.py**: Calculates the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
2. **euler2.py**: Finds the sum of even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million.
3. **euler3.py**: Finds the largest prime factor of a given number.
4. **euler4.py**: Finds the largest palindrome product of two 3-digit numbers.
5. **euler5.py**: Finds the smallest positive number evenly divisible by all numbers from 1 to 20.
6. **euler6.py**: Calculates the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of squares of the first 100
   natural numbers.
7. **euler7.py**: Generates the nth prime number.
8. **euler8.py**: Finds the largest product of 13 adjacent digits in a given number.
   
## Usage

To use the scripts:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
3. Run each script using Python (e.g., `python euler1.py`).

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have an efficient solution to a Project Euler problem that is not
yet included here, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer

Please note that while these solutions provide answers to the Project Euler problems, they may not always be the most
optimized or efficient solutions. They are intended to demonstrate problem-solving techniques and Python programming
skills.

Happy coding!
